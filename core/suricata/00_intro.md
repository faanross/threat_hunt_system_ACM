## **Introduction**

Suricata is a high-performance Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and Network Security Monitoring (NSM) engine that analyzes network traffic in real-time, matching packets against thousands of rules to identify known attack patterns, malicious payloads, and suspicious behaviours.

Unlike behavioural analysis tools like Zeek, RITA, and AC-Hunter, which focus on connection metadata and statistical anomalies, Suricata excels at **signature-based detection** - recognizing specific byte patterns, protocol violations, and known exploit techniques as they traverse the network.

Together, Suricata and Zeek/RITA/AC-Hunter form a complementary detection strategy: the latter identifies _behavioural_ anomalies (unusual beaconing patterns, rare User-Agents, long connections), while Suricata identifies _signature-based_ threats (known malware families, exploit kits, C2 frameworks). Where RITA and AC-Hunter ask "does this connection _behave_suspiciously?", Suricata asks "does this traffic contain something malicious?"



## **What is Suricata?**

### **Origins and Evolution**

Suricata was created in 2009 by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), a non-profit organization dedicated to developing open-source security technologies. The project was initiated to address limitations in existing intrusion detection systems, particularly Snort, which despite its dominance in the IDS/IPS market, faced challenges with multi-threaded performance and modern protocol support.

The name "Suricata" comes from the scientific name _Suricata suricatta_, referring to the meerkat - a highly alert, cooperative animal known for its vigilant monitoring behaviour. This symbolism reflects Suricata's design philosophy: constant vigilance, cooperative detection (through rule sharing and threat intelligence integration), and alertness to emerging threats.

### **Architecture and Design Philosophy**

Suricata's architecture represents a significant evolution from single-threaded IDS implementations. Its design emphasizes several core principles:

**Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing**: Unlike traditional IDS systems that process packets serially, Suricata distributes workload across multiple CPU cores. Different threads handle packet acquisition, decoding, detection, and logging - maximizing hardware utilization and throughput.

**Protocol Awareness**: Suricata includes deep protocol parsers for HTTP, TLS/SSL, DNS, SMB, FTP, SSH, SMTP, and dozens of other protocols. These parsers extract protocol-specific fields (HTTP headers, TLS certificates, DNS queries) and make them available for inspection and logging.

**Dual-Mode Operation**: Suricata can operate as either a passive IDS (monitoring traffic and generating alerts) or an active IPS (inline mode, blocking malicious traffic in real-time). This flexibility allows organizations to deploy Suricata in detection-only mode initially, then transition to prevention once rules are tuned.

**Rule-Based Detection**: At its core, Suricata uses **rules** - pattern-matching signatures that describe malicious traffic. These rules can match on packet headers, payload content, protocol anomalies, and extracted protocol fields. Rules are organized by threat categories and regularly updated to detect new threats.

**File Extraction and Analysis**: Suricata can extract files transmitted over the network (via HTTP, SMB, FTP, SMTP) and calculate file hashes, enabling integration with malware sandboxes and threat intelligence platforms.

**Logging and Output**: Suricata produces multiple log formats including EVE JSON (a unified structured log containing all events), traditional fast.log alerts, and extracted files. This rich telemetry integrates easily with SIEM platforms, log aggregators, and threat hunting tools.

**Extensibility**: Through Lua scripting and Python integration, Suricata can be extended with custom detection logic that goes beyond simple pattern matching.


### **Core Capabilities**

Suricata's capabilities span several critical security functions:

**Intrusion Detection (IDS Mode)**: Monitors network traffic passively, generating alerts when rules match. Traffic flows uninterrupted; Suricata simply observes and reports.

**Intrusion Prevention (IPS Mode)**: Operates inline, actively blocking traffic that matches configured rules. Can drop packets, reset connections, or reject sessions in real-time.

**Protocol Analysis**: Deep inspection of application-layer protocols, extracting metadata and identifying protocol violations or anomalies.

**File Extraction**: Captures files transmitted over the network, enabling malware analysis and threat intelligence correlation.

**TLS/SSL Inspection**: Logs TLS certificates, cipher suites, and JA3/JA3S fingerprints (hashing TLS handshake characteristics for client/server fingerprinting).

**DNS Monitoring**: Logs DNS queries and responses, enabling detection of DNS tunnelling, DGA domains, and malicious domain lookups.

**HTTP Transaction Logging**: Records complete HTTP transactions including headers, User-Agents, URIs, and response codes.

**SMB Protocol Analysis**: Monitors file sharing activity, detecting lateral movement and suspicious file transfers.

**Anomaly Detection**: Identifies protocol violations, malformed packets, and traffic that deviates from RFC specifications.

**Threat Intelligence Integration**: Matches traffic against IP reputation lists, domain blacklists, and file hash databases.
