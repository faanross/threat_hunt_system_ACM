## **PART 1: THE EVOLUTION OF ZEEK - FROM RESEARCH PROJECT TO ENTERPRISE STAPLE**

### **The Birth of Something Different**

In 1995, a PhD student at UC Berkeley named Vern Paxson was working on his dissertation at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The laboratory had a problem that was becoming increasingly common in the mid-1990s: their network was under constant probing and attack, but existing intrusion detection systems weren't giving them the visibility they needed. These systems, which primarily relied on signature matching, could tell you if a known attack pattern appeared in your traffic, but they couldn't tell you much about what was actually happening on the network moment to moment.

Paxson approached the problem differently. Instead of building yet another signature-matching system, he asked himself: "What if we built a system that could continuously observe network activity, understand the protocols being used, track the state of connections, and provide a rich stream of information about what's really happening?" This question led to the creation of Bro - originally standing for "Big Brother," a reference to Orwell's all-seeing surveillance system, though in this case watching networks rather than people.

The early version of Bro that emerged from Paxson's research had several revolutionary characteristics that set it apart from everything else available at the time. First, it was designed to be completely passive. Rather than sitting inline and potentially becoming a bottleneck or single point of failure, Bro would observe a copy of network traffic without interfering with it. Second, it **separated policy from mechanism**. The core engine would handle the hard work of parsing protocols and tracking connection state, while separate scripts - written in a custom scripting language - would implement the detection logic. This meant that security analysts could customize detection behaviour without modifying the core system.

Third, and perhaps most importantly, Bro was designed to generate rich logs about network activity whether or not any suspicious behaviour was detected. This was a radical departure from traditional intrusion detection systems, which primarily generated alerts when signature matches occurred. Paxson understood that for real network security monitoring, you needed to understand baseline behavior, track long-term trends, and have detailed forensic data available when investigating incidents.
