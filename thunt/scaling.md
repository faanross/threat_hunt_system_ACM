# The Scale Problem: Why Threat Hunting Becomes Exponentially Harder in Large Environments

A threat hunter joins a 500-employee startup. The environment is manageable: 500 endpoints running standardized builds, a handful of servers, two cloud tenants, and straightforward network architecture. Within weeks, they understand the environment. Baselines are clear. Anomalies stand out. Hunts yield results quickly. The hunter feels effective.

Two years later, they join a 50,000-employee global enterprise. Same skills, same methodology, same dedication. Yet everything is harder. The environment sprawls across continents with inconsistent configurations. Baselining takes months and never finishes because the environment constantly changes. Anomalies are everywhere, but which ones matter? Hunts that worked perfectly in the small environment produce overwhelming noise in the large one. The hunter struggles, not from lack of skill but from environmental complexity they've never encountered.

This is the scale problem: threat hunting difficulty doesn't increase linearly with environment size - it increases exponentially. A threat hunter effective in a 1,000-endpoint environment isn't automatically effective in a 10,000-endpoint environment. The skills transfer, but the environmental complexity creates challenges of a different magnitude entirely.
