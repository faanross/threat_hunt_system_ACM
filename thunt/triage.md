# Why Perfect Coverage is the Enemy of Good Security

A new threat hunting program at a 10,000-employee organization faces a daunting reality: 15,000 endpoints, 2,000 servers, hundreds of applications, cloud infrastructure across three providers, remote users worldwide, millions of daily authentication events, and terabytes of logs. The hunting team consists of three people.

The math is brutal. Even with larger teams, comprehensive coverage remains fantasy. Yet the organization expects the hunting program to provide value, demonstrate effectiveness, and justify continued investment - ideally within months, not years.

This fundamental dilemma defines modern threat hunting: resources are finite while potential scope is effectively infinite. Every hour spent hunting one area is an hour not spent on others. How do you allocate scarce hunting resources to maximize security value?

The answer lies not in working harder or faster, but in embracing a counterintuitive truth: attempting to hunt everything means hunting nothing effectively. Success requires the discipline to prioritize ruthlessly, accepting that skewed coverage of critical areas provides more value than attempting comprehensive coverage of everything.
