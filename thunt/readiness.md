# Organizational Readiness and Prerequisites

## The Readiness Reality Check

Imagine trying to perform surgery without proper medical equipment, training, or even a basic understanding of human anatomy. The attempt would be worse than useless - it would be actively harmful. Yet organizations regularly attempt threat hunting without the foundational capabilities that make hunting possible, let alone effective. They hire hunters, deploy hunting platforms, and launch hunting programs, only to discover that they lack the data, tools, processes, or organizational structure needed for hunting to succeed.

The results are predictable: frustrated hunters unable to do their jobs, wasted investment in tools and personnel, leadership disappointment when hunting fails to deliver promised value, and organizational cynicism about security initiatives that creates barriers to future improvements. These failures aren't because threat hunting doesn't work - they're because organizations attempted hunting before they were ready.

This chapter provides a reality check: what prerequisites must be in place before launching a threat hunting program? What technical capabilities, organizational structures, and cultural attributes are required? How do you honestly assess whether you're ready, and what should you do if you're not ready yet? Most importantly, how do you avoid the costly mistake of premature hunting investment that undermines both immediate effectiveness and future security initiatives?

The core message is simple but critical: threat hunting is resource-intensive and requires solid fundamentals. Organizations should only undertake hunting when prerequisites are in place. If prerequisites are lacking, investing in hunting directly is putting cart before horse - better to invest first in building the foundation that makes hunting possible.
