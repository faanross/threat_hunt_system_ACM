# The Threat Hunting Maturity Model

## The Maturity Question

One of the most common questions organizations ask when considering threat hunting is simply: "Are we ready?" It's a deceptively complex question. You might have a skilled security team, significant budget, and executive support - but still not be ready for effective threat hunting. Conversely, a smaller organization with the right foundational capabilities might be better positioned to succeed than a larger one with impressive but poorly integrated security tools.

The challenge is that "readiness" isn't binary. Organizations don't transition overnight from "not ready" to "ready for hunting." Instead, hunting capabilities develop along a maturity continuum, with each level building on capabilities established at previous levels. Trying to skip levels - attempting sophisticated hunting without foundational capabilities - almost always fails, wasting resources and creating frustration that can poison future security initiatives.

This is where maturity models become invaluable. A good maturity model helps you honestly assess where you are, understand what capabilities you need to develop next, and chart a realistic path toward more sophisticated hunting. It prevents premature investments in capabilities you're not ready to use effectively, and it provides clear milestones to demonstrate progress to leadership.

This chapter explores the Hunting Maturity Model (HMM), the most widely adopted framework for assessing organizational hunting readiness and capability. Understanding this model helps prevent one of the most common and expensive mistakes in security: attempting advanced security operations before foundational capabilities are in place.

## The Hunting Maturity Model: Overview

The Hunting Maturity Model, originally developed by Sqrrl and later refined by the broader security community, describes five maturity levels ranging from HMM0 (initial/ad-hoc) through HMM4 (leading practice). Each level represents progressively more sophisticated capabilities, better integration with other security functions, and greater organizational impact.

Hunting Maturity Model Levels
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HMM4 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
LEADING             • Automation-assisted hunting
                    • Continuous innovation
                    • Intelligence production
                    • Industry leadership

HMM3 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROCEDURAL          • Formal hunting procedures
                    • Regular scheduled hunts
                    • Integrated with security ops
                    • Documented playbooks

HMM2 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
REPEATABLE          • Dedicated hunting resources
                    • Data collection defined
                    • Basic hunting procedures
                    • Regular but informal hunting

HMM1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
INITIAL             • Sporadic hunting attempts
                    • Minimal data collection
                    • Crisis-driven
                    • No formal process

HMM0 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
AD-HOC              • No hunting capability
                    • Purely reactive security
                    • Minimal logging
                    • Alert-driven only
```

The model is descriptive, not prescriptive - it describes what characterizes each level without mandating a single path for advancement. Organizations should focus on building genuine capabilities rather than "checking boxes" to claim a particular maturity level.

Importantly, higher maturity isn't always better in absolute terms. A mature hunting program at HMM3 or HMM4 requires significant ongoing investment in people, tools, and processes. Some organizations are better served by a solid HMM2 capability that's well-maintained and integrated rather than stretching resources to achieve HMM4. The goal is appropriate maturity for your organization's risk profile, resources, and threat landscape - not maximum maturity regardless of context.
