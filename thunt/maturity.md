# The Threat Hunting Maturity Model

## The Maturity Question

One of the most common questions organizations ask when considering threat hunting is simply: "Are we ready?" It's a deceptively complex question. You might have a skilled security team, significant budget, and executive support - but still not be ready for effective threat hunting. Conversely, a smaller organization with the right foundational capabilities might be better positioned to succeed than a larger one with impressive but poorly integrated security tools.

The challenge is that "readiness" isn't binary. Organizations don't transition overnight from "not ready" to "ready for hunting." Instead, hunting capabilities develop along a maturity continuum, with each level building on capabilities established at previous levels. Trying to skip levels - attempting sophisticated hunting without foundational capabilities - almost always fails, wasting resources and creating frustration that can poison future security initiatives.

This is where maturity models become invaluable. A good maturity model helps you honestly assess where you are, understand what capabilities you need to develop next, and chart a realistic path toward more sophisticated hunting. It prevents premature investments in capabilities you're not ready to use effectively, and it provides clear milestones to demonstrate progress to leadership.

This chapter explores the Hunting Maturity Model (HMM), the most widely adopted framework for assessing organizational hunting readiness and capability. Understanding this model helps prevent one of the most common and expensive mistakes in security: attempting advanced security operations before foundational capabilities are in place.

## The Hunting Maturity Model: Overview

The Hunting Maturity Model, originally developed by Sqrrl and later refined by the broader security community, describes five maturity levels ranging from HMM0 (initial/ad-hoc) through HMM4 (leading practice). Each level represents progressively more sophisticated capabilities, better integration with other security functions, and greater organizational impact.

```

                    • Alert-driven only
```

The model is descriptive, not prescriptive - it describes what characterizes each level without mandating a single path for advancement. Organizations should focus on building genuine capabilities rather than "checking boxes" to claim a particular maturity level.

Importantly, higher maturity isn't always better in absolute terms. A mature hunting program at HMM3 or HMM4 requires significant ongoing investment in people, tools, and processes. Some organizations are better served by a solid HMM2 capability that's well-maintained and integrated rather than stretching resources to achieve HMM4. The goal is appropriate maturity for your organization's risk profile, resources, and threat landscape - not maximum maturity regardless of context.


## HMM0: Initial (No Hunting Capability)

### Characteristics

Organizations at HMM0 have no threat hunting capability. Security operations are purely reactive, responding to alerts generated by automated systems. When asked "How do you hunt for threats?" the honest answer is "We don't - we respond to alerts."

This doesn't mean these organizations have no security program. They may have firewalls, antivirus, SIEM systems, and dedicated security staff. But their operational model is fundamentally reactive: wait for alerts, investigate alerts, respond to confirmed incidents. There's no proactive searching for threats that haven't triggered alerts.

Key characteristics include:

**Limited Data Collection**: Logging is minimal, often limited to what's required for compliance. Critical data sources like full packet capture, detailed endpoint telemetry, or comprehensive authentication logs may not exist. Data that is collected is often retained briefly due to storage constraints.

**Alert-Driven Operations**: SOC analysts spend all their time triaging and investigating alerts. There's no capacity for proactive investigation because alert volume consumes all available analyst time.

**Minimal Baseline Understanding**: The organization has limited documentation of what "normal" looks like. Without baselines, distinguishing anomalies from routine activity is difficult or impossible.

**Tool-Dependent Detection**: Security relies entirely on automated tool detection. If tools don't generate alerts, threats go undetected regardless of how much evidence might exist in logs.

**Reactive Posture**: Security incidents are discovered through alerts, user reports, or external notification - never through proactive internal investigation.

### Why Organizations Remain at HMM0

Many organizations stay at HMM0 not because they're unaware of threat hunting but because they face legitimate constraints:

**Resource Limitations**: Small security teams handling high alert volumes have no spare capacity for proactive hunting. Adding hunting without first improving alert quality and SOC efficiency would simply break operations.

**Technical Debt**: Legacy systems, insufficient logging, and fragmented tools create an environment where hunting would be technically infeasible even if personnel had time.

**Maturity Dependencies**: Organizations lacking basic security operations capabilities (asset inventory, configuration management, incident response procedures) aren't ready for hunting's additional complexity.

**Budget Constraints**: Expanding data collection, deploying hunting tools, and hiring skilled personnel requires budget that may not be available or may be allocated to more pressing security needs.


### The Path Forward from HMM0

Organizations at HMM0 should focus on foundational capabilities rather than jumping directly to hunting:

**Improve Data Collection**: Expand logging to include critical security data sources. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools that provide detailed telemetry. Increase log retention to support historical analysis.

**Optimize SOC Operations**: Reduce alert volume through better tuning and elimination of low-value alerts. This creates capacity for proactive activities. Improve analyst efficiency through better tools, training, and procedures.

**Develop Baselines**: Document normal behaviour for critical systems, users, and network traffic. Without understanding "normal," hunting for "abnormal" is impossible.

**Build Asset Inventory**: Maintain comprehensive asset inventory so you know what you're protecting. You can only hunt across systems you know exist.

**Establish Incident Response**: Develop basic incident response capabilities so that when hunting eventually discovers threats, you can respond effectively.

The goal at this stage isn't to start hunting immediately but to build the foundation that makes hunting possible. Organizations that skip these foundational steps and attempt hunting anyway typically produce minimal value and waste resources.


## HMM1: Initial (Sporadic Hunting)

### Characteristics

At HMM1, organizations begin attempting threat hunting, but in an ad-hoc, crisis-driven manner. Hunting happens sporadically - usually after incidents or when specific intelligence suggests particular threats - rather than as regular operational activity.

Key characteristics include:

**Crisis-Driven Hunting**: Hunting occurs primarily in response to specific events: after a breach, following external threat intelligence, or when leadership demands investigation of particular concerns. There's no regular hunting cadence.

**Individual Initiative**: Hunting depends on individual analysts taking initiative rather than organizational mandate. If particular skilled analysts leave, hunting capability may disappear.

**Minimal Process**: Little to no formal hunting process exists. Hunters use whatever approaches seem appropriate at the time, with minimal documentation or methodology.

**Limited Tool Support**: Hunting relies primarily on existing SOC tools (SIEM, EDR) used in non-standard ways. No dedicated hunting platforms or specialized tools are available.

**Inconsistent Data Access**: Data needed for hunting exists but may be difficult to access, poorly integrated, or inconsistently collected across the environment.

**No Dedicated Resources**: Hunters are SOC analysts, incident responders, or security engineers conducting hunting alongside their primary responsibilities when time permits.

### The Value and Limitations of HMM1

HMM1 represents important progress - the organization recognizes hunting's value and attempts it, even if inconsistently. These sporadic hunts occasionally discover threats, validate security controls, and build organizational knowledge. Individual hunters develop skills and demonstrate hunting's potential value.

However, HMM1 has significant limitations:

**Inconsistent Coverage**: Sporadic hunting means long gaps where no proactive threat detection occurs. Adversaries present during these gaps go undetected.

**Knowledge Loss**: Without documentation and process, knowledge gained from hunts isn't captured or shared effectively. Each hunt reinvents approaches rather than building on previous work.

**Unsustainable**: Hunting as "extra duty" alongside primary responsibilities is difficult to sustain. When alert volume increases or other pressures arise, hunting is first to be deprioritized.

**Limited Impact**: Without regular hunting and systematic improvement, the feedback loop that makes hunting increasingly effective never fully develops.


### Advancing from HMM1 to HMM2

The critical transition from HMM1 to HMM2 involves moving from sporadic, crisis-driven hunting to regular, sustainable hunting capability:

**Formalize Hunting Time**: Allocate dedicated time for hunting activities - perhaps Friday afternoons for SOC analysts, or 20% of security engineer time. Make hunting part of regular responsibilities rather than "extra" work.

**Document Approaches**: Begin capturing hunting hypotheses, investigation approaches, and findings. Even simple documentation enables knowledge sharing and prevents redundant work.

**Establish Basic Process**: Adopt a simple hunting methodology (perhaps elements from frameworks discussed in Chapter 6) that provides consistency without excessive overhead.

**Improve Data Access**: Ensure that data needed for common hunting activities is readily accessible. This might mean improved SIEM search capabilities, better EDR query interfaces, or simple scripts that aggregate data from multiple sources.

**Build Hunting Knowledge**: Develop a shared repository of hunting techniques, environment baselines, and investigation approaches. This accelerates new hunters' learning and preserves organizational knowledge.



## HMM2: Repeatable (Defined Data Collections)

### Characteristics

At HMM2, hunting becomes a regular, repeatable activity with defined data collections and basic procedures. While not yet fully formalized, hunting has moved from exceptional to routine.

Key characteristics include:

**Regular Hunting Cadence**: Hunting occurs on a predictable schedule rather than sporadically. This might be weekly hunt sessions, monthly focused hunts, or continuous hunting by rotating team members.

**Defined Data Sources**: The organization has identified and configured data sources specifically to support hunting. Hunters know what data is available, how to access it, and what questions each data source can answer.

**Dedicated Resources**: While hunting might still be a part-time responsibility, specific individuals are designated as hunters with protected time for hunting activities.

**Basic Procedures**: Documented hunting procedures exist, even if informal. Hunters follow general approaches for hypothesis generation, investigation, and documentation.

**Knowledge Repository**: A shared location (wiki, document repository, ticket system) captures hunting activities, findings, and techniques. Knowledge begins accumulating systematically.

**Integration with Detection Engineering**: Findings from hunts begin feeding into detection rule creation, creating the feedback loop that continuously improves automated detection.

### The Inflection Point

HMM2 represents an important inflection point where hunting transitions from experimental to operational. The activity becomes sustainable because it's integrated into regular operations rather than dependent on individual initiative or crisis motivation.

Organizations at HMM2 begin seeing hunting's cumulative benefits:

**Progressive Coverage**: Regular hunting means systematic exploration of the threat landscape rather than reactive investigation of specific concerns.

**Skill Development**: Consistent practice develops hunters' skills more effectively than sporadic attempts. Hunters become increasingly proficient with tools and techniques.

**Environmental Knowledge**: Regular exposure to environment data deepens hunters' understanding of normal behavior, making anomaly detection increasingly effective.

**Detection Improvement**: The feedback loop between hunting discoveries and automated detection begins producing measurable improvements in overall detection capability.

### Challenges at HMM2

Despite progress, HMM2 organizations face several challenges:

**Inconsistent Quality**: Without formal procedures and quality assurance, hunting quality varies significantly between hunters and over time.

**Limited Scope**: Hunting often focuses on familiar areas where data is readily accessible, potentially missing threats in less-explored parts of the environment.

**Scaling Difficulties**: As hunting ambitions grow, the informal processes and part-time resources that work at small scale become constraints.

**Measurement Challenges**: Without formal metrics and tracking, demonstrating hunting value to leadership can be difficult, making it hard to justify additional investment.

### Advancing from HMM2 to HMM3

The transition to HMM3 requires formalizing and systematizing capabilities developed informally at HMM2:

**Formalize Procedures**: Document detailed hunting procedures, playbooks, and standard operating procedures. This enables consistent quality and easier training of new hunters.

**Dedicated Hunting Team**: Establish a dedicated hunting function rather than hunting as part-time duty. This might be a small team or even one full-time hunter initially.

**Comprehensive Data Strategy**: Move beyond opportunistic data collection to strategic data architecture designed to support hunting. This includes expanding data sources, improving retention, and enhancing data access tools.

**Metrics and Reporting**: Establish metrics for hunting effectiveness and regular reporting to leadership. This demonstrates value and justifies investment in advancing capabilities.

**Tool Investment**: Deploy dedicated hunting platforms or significantly enhance existing tools to support efficient hunting at scale.


## HMM3: Procedural (Formal Procedures)

### Characteristics

HMM3 represents mature hunting capability with formal procedures, dedicated resources, and strong integration with other security functions. Hunting is a well-established security capability that operates consistently and delivers measurable value.

Key characteristics include:

**Dedicated Hunting Team**: A distinct hunting function exists with dedicated personnel whose primary responsibility is threat hunting. This might be 1-2 people in smaller organizations or 5-10+ in larger enterprises.

**Formal Methodology**: The organization has adopted and customized a formal hunting methodology appropriate to their context. Procedures are documented, taught, and consistently followed.

**Comprehensive Playbooks**: Detailed hunting playbooks exist for common scenarios, specific threat types, and particular techniques. New hunters can follow playbooks to conduct effective hunts even without extensive experience.

**Systematic Coverage**: Hunting activities are planned to provide systematic coverage of the threat landscape. The team tracks which areas have been investigated, when, and with what results.

**Quality Assurance**: Peer review, senior hunter oversight, or other quality assurance mechanisms ensure consistent hunting quality across the team.

**Integrated with Security Operations**: Hunting is tightly integrated with SOC operations, incident response, threat intelligence, and detection engineering. Clear procedures govern handoffs, information sharing, and collaboration.

**Advanced Data Infrastructure**: Comprehensive data collection, extended retention, and powerful query capabilities support efficient hunting across the entire environment.

**Regular Reporting**: Hunting activities and findings are reported regularly to security leadership and other stakeholders through established reporting mechanisms.

### The Operational Maturity

HMM3 represents operational maturity where hunting is a well-oiled machine. The function operates reliably, delivers consistent value, and requires less constant attention from leadership. New hunters can be onboarded effectively through documented procedures and playbooks. The organization has confidence that hunting coverage is comprehensive rather than haphazard.

This maturity brings several advantages:

**Predictable Resource Planning**: With established procedures and dedicated resources, capacity planning becomes straightforward. You know how many hunts your team can conduct monthly and can plan accordingly.

**Defensible Methodology**: Formal procedures mean you can demonstrate systematic methodology to auditors, leadership, or external parties. Your hunting isn't ad-hoc - it's following established, defensible processes.

**Scalable Training**: Documented procedures and playbooks enable effective training of new team members. Organizations can grow hunting teams without requiring years for new hunters to become productive.

**Measurable Impact**: With systematic operation and good metrics, hunting's value becomes clearly demonstrable. You can show leadership specific threats discovered, detection improvements made, and coverage achieved.

### Challenges and Limitations at HMM3

Despite maturity, HMM3 organizations face challenges:

**Procedural Rigidity**: Extensive procedures can sometimes constrain creative hunting. Balancing consistency with flexibility remains an ongoing challenge.

**Complacency Risk**: Successful routine operations can breed complacency. Teams may continue hunting familiar areas using established approaches while missing emerging threats requiring new techniques.

**Resource Intensive**: Maintaining mature hunting capability requires sustained investment in people, tools, and infrastructure. Budget pressures may threaten capability sustainment.

**Keeping Pace with Threats**: As adversary techniques evolve, hunting procedures must evolve correspondingly. This requires continuous learning, research, and playbook updates.

### Advancing from HMM3 to HMM4

The transition from HMM3 to HMM4 involves moving beyond operational maturity to innovation and leadership:

**Automation Integration**: Develop capabilities to use machine learning, analytics, and automation to augment human hunting rather than replace it.

**Intelligence Production**: Transition from intelligence consumption to intelligence production, generating original threat intelligence from hunting discoveries.

**Research and Innovation**: Dedicate resources to developing novel hunting techniques, tools, and approaches rather than only following established practices.

**Community Leadership**: Share knowledge publicly, contribute to community development, and help advance threat hunting as a discipline beyond your organization.

**Continuous Optimization**: Systematically measure and optimize hunting effectiveness, continuously refining approaches based on empirical results.



## HMM4: Leading (Innovation and Automation)

### Characteristics

HMM4 represents leading-edge hunting capability where organizations not only operate mature hunting programs but actively innovate and contribute to advancing the discipline. These organizations are pushing boundaries, developing new techniques, and often sharing knowledge that benefits the entire security community.

Key characteristics include:

**Automation-Assisted Hunting**: Sophisticated use of machine learning, behavioral analytics, and automation to surface anomalies for human investigation. Automation handles initial data reduction and pattern recognition while humans provide creative investigation and contextual judgment.

**Continuous Innovation**: Dedicated resources for research and development of new hunting techniques, tools, and approaches. The team doesn't just follow established practices but actively develops new ones.

**Intelligence Production**: The organization produces original threat intelligence from hunting discoveries. These insights are shared (appropriately) with the security community, industry partners, or intelligence sharing organizations.

**Advanced Analytics**: Sophisticated analytical techniques - statistical analysis, graph analytics, machine learning - are integrated into regular hunting workflows.

**Community Contribution**: The organization actively contributes to the security community through conference presentations, blog posts, open-source tool contributions, or published research.

**Metrics-Driven Optimization**: Comprehensive metrics enable empirical assessment of hunting effectiveness. The organization continuously refines approaches based on measured outcomes.

**Threat Actor Profiling**: Deep understanding of specific threat actors and their TTPs enables anticipatory hunting - searching for threats based on predictive understanding of adversary behavior.

### The Innovation Frontier

HMM4 organizations operate at the frontier of threat hunting capability. They're not just implementing best practices - they're defining what best practices will become. This requires different mindsets and capabilities than operational excellence:

**Research Orientation**: HMM4 hunters spend significant time on research - reading academic papers, studying adversary campaigns, experimenting with new tools and techniques. They're as much researchers as operators.

**Tool Development**: Rather than only using commercial tools, HMM4 organizations often develop custom tools, scripts, and platforms tailored to their specific needs and hunting approaches.

**Adversary Focus**: Deep understanding of specific adversary groups means hunting isn't just technique-focused but adversary-aware. Hunters know specific groups' behaviors, tools, and operational patterns.

**Cross-Functional Integration**: Hunting integrates deeply with red teams, threat intelligence, malware analysis, and other advanced functions. This integration enables sophisticated capabilities impossible with hunting alone.

### Who Reaches HMM4 and Why

HMM4 is rare. Most organizations don't need and shouldn't aspire to HMM4 capabilities. The investment required is substantial, and the return only justifies it in specific contexts:

**High-Value Targets**: Organizations likely to face sophisticated adversaries (major technology companies, financial institutions, defense contractors, government agencies) benefit from HMM4 capabilities.

**Sufficient Scale**: Large organizations with extensive environments can leverage HMM4 capabilities across broad scope, justifying the investment.

**Strategic Priority**: Organizations where security is strategic priority rather than cost center can sustain investment in leading-edge capabilities.

**Talent Availability**: HMM4 requires exceptional talent - hunters who are also researchers, developers, and innovators. Such talent is scarce and expensive.

### The Value and Cost of HMM4

HMM4 capabilities provide several unique advantages:

**Early Detection of Novel Threats**: Innovation enables detection of threats before they're widely recognized. HMM4 organizations often discover new attack techniques months before they appear in threat intelligence.

**Competitive Intelligence**: Deep threat understanding provides strategic intelligence about adversary capabilities, intentions, and likely future actions.

**Industry Leadership**: Public contribution builds organizational reputation, aids recruiting, and establishes thought leadership.

**Maximum Detection Coverage**: Sophisticated analytics and automation achieve broader, deeper coverage than human-only hunting can provide.

However, costs are substantial:

**Talent Competition**: Hiring and retaining HMM4-level talent requires competing with tech giants and elite consultancies for scarce experts.

**Sustained Investment**: Tools, infrastructure, research time, and continuous learning require ongoing substantial budget.

**Diminishing Returns**: The incremental security improvement from HMM3 to HMM4 may be smaller than the investment required, depending on threat profile.

**Complexity Management**: Advanced capabilities introduce complexity that can create new failure modes if not managed carefully.

## Choosing Your Target Maturity

A critical question for any organization is: what maturity level should we target? The answer depends on multiple factors rather than a simple "higher is better" rule.

Reality: Most organizations target HMM2-3

```


### Realistic Targets by Organization Type

**Small Organizations (< 500 employees)**: HMM1-2 is realistic. Focus on foundational security, periodic hunting activities integrated with SOC operations, and leveraging external resources (consultants, managed services) for advanced hunting needs.

**Medium Organizations (500-5,000 employees)**: HMM2-3 is achievable. Establish regular hunting capability with 1-3 dedicated hunters, formal procedures, and good integration with security operations.

**Large Enterprises (5,000-50,000 employees)**: HMM3 is appropriate target with HMM4 capabilities in specific high-risk areas. Dedicated hunting teams, comprehensive procedures, and mature integration with security ecosystem.

**Mega-Scale Organizations (>50,000 employees) or High-Risk Sectors**: HMM3-4 capabilities justified. Multiple hunting teams, advanced analytics, innovation programs, and potentially intelligence production.

### The Progressive Path

Regardless of target, advancement should be progressive. Skipping levels is tempting but rarely successful. Each maturity level builds on capabilities developed at previous levels:

**HMM0 → HMM1**: Build foundational data collection, optimize SOC operations, begin exploratory hunting 

**HMM1 → HMM2**: Establish regular hunting cadence, document procedures, designate hunting resources 

**HMM2 → HMM3**: Formalize procedures, establish dedicated team, develop comprehensive playbooks 

**HMM3 → HMM4**: Integrate automation, develop innovation capability, contribute to community

Trying to jump from **HMM0 -> HMM3** - hiring hunting teams and deploying sophisticated tools without foundational capabilities - almost always fails. The hunting team has insufficient data, inadequate baselines, and no established integration with security operations. Resources are wasted, the program struggles, and leadership loses confidence in hunting's value.

## Common Maturity Mistakes

Several common mistakes occur when organizations misunderstand or misapply maturity models:

### Mistake 1: Maturity Level as Goal Rather Than Capability

Some organizations fixate on achieving a specific maturity level as an end in itself: "We must reach HMM3 by year-end." This puts cart before horse. Maturity levels describe capabilities, not objectives. The goal should be developing specific capabilities that improve security posture - the maturity level is simply a descriptor of where you end up.

### Mistake 2: Checkbox Compliance

Related to the first mistake, some organizations try to "check boxes" to claim a maturity level without building genuine capability. They create hunting procedures that nobody follows, designate hunters who have no time for hunting, or conduct perfunctory hunts just to claim they're happening. This is security theater - appearing mature without being effective.

### Mistake 3: Tool-Driven Advancement

Organizations sometimes believe that purchasing sophisticated tools advances maturity. They buy hunting platforms marketed for "HMM3-4 capabilities" while their actual operations remain HMM1. Tools enable capabilities but don't create them. People, processes, and foundational data must be in place before tools provide value.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Prerequisites

Each maturity level requires prerequisites. You can't effectively hunt (HMM1+) without adequate data collection (HMM0→1 transition). You can't maintain regular hunting (HMM2) without optimized SOC operations freeing capacity. Ignoring prerequisites means building on sand - apparent progress that collapses under pressure.

### Mistake 5: Permanent Maturity Fallacy

Organizations sometimes believe that once they achieve a maturity level, it's permanent. In reality, maturity requires sustained investment and attention. Budget cuts, talent attrition, or organizational changes can cause regression. HMM3 organizations that neglect their hunting programs can find themselves effectively back at HMM1 or HMM2 within a year or two.

## Assessing Your Current Maturity

How do you honestly assess your organization's current hunting maturity? Several approaches help:

### Self-Assessment Framework

Answer these questions honestly for each maturity level:

**HMM0/1 Boundary**:

- Do we conduct any proactive threat hunting, or only respond to alerts?
- Do we have sufficient data collection to support hunting if we wanted to?
- Do any team members have time and mandate to conduct hunting activities?

**HMM1/2 Boundary**:

- Do we hunt regularly (weekly/monthly) or only sporadically?
- Are hunting activities documented and knowledge shared?
- Do we have designated hunting resources with protected time?

**HMM2/3 Boundary**:

- Do we have formal hunting procedures and playbooks?
- Is there a dedicated hunting function (even if small)?
- Do we systematically track hunting coverage and effectiveness?

**HMM3/4 Boundary**:

- Do we innovate in hunting techniques rather than only following established practices?
- Do we integrate sophisticated automation and analytics into hunting?
- Do we produce original threat intelligence and contribute to the community?

Your current maturity is the highest level where you can honestly answer "yes" to all questions.

### Capability-Based Assessment

Rather than focusing on maturity levels, assess specific capabilities:

- **Data Collection**: What data sources are available? How comprehensive? How accessible? 
- **Process Maturity**: Are hunting processes documented? Consistently followed? Quality-assured? 
- **Resource Allocation**: How much time is dedicated to hunting? By how many people? 
- **Tool Sophistication**: What tools support hunting? How effectively are they used? 
- **Integration**: How well does hunting integrate with SOC, IR, threat intelligence? 
- **Knowledge Management**: How are hunting findings captured, shared, and operationalized? 
- **Measurement**: How is hunting effectiveness measured and reported?

This capability assessment often provides more actionable insight than simply identifying a maturity level.

### External Benchmarking

Compare your capabilities against peer organizations. Industry forums, conferences, and informal networking provide opportunities to understand what "typical" looks like for organizations similar to yours in size, sector, and threat profile. This helps calibrate expectations - perhaps what you thought was HMM2 is actually HMM1, or vice versa.

## Planning Your Advancement

Once you've honestly assessed current maturity, how do you plan advancement to your target maturity?

### Build a Roadmap

Create a multi-year roadmap identifying:

- **Current State**: Where are we now? What capabilities exist? 
- **Target State**: Where do we want to be in 2-3 years?
- **Intermediate Milestones**: What capabilities need development in what sequence? 
- **Dependencies**: What prerequisites must be in place before advancing? 
- **Resource Requirements**: What investments in people, tools, and processes are required? 
- **Success Metrics**: How will we know we've achieved each milestone?

This roadmap should be realistic about time frames. Advancing from HMM0 to HMM2 might take 18-24 months. Reaching HMM3 might take 3-4 years. Rushing the process typically produces superficial capabilities that don't deliver value.

### Prioritize Foundations

At every stage, prioritize foundational capabilities over advanced features. Better to have solid HMM2 capability than shakily-implemented HMM3 procedures built on inadequate foundations. When faced with investment choices, ask: "Does this strengthen fundamentals or add advanced capabilities?" Early in maturity progression, fundamentals almost always deserve priority.

### Celebrate Progress

Maturity advancement is gradual, and it's easy to become frustrated with slow progress. Celebrate intermediate achievements: completing your first documented hunt, establishing regular hunting cadence, creating your first hunting playbook, hiring your first dedicated hunter. These milestones represent genuine progress even if you haven't reached target maturity.

### Accept Non-Linear Progress

Advancement isn't always linear. You might make rapid progress in some areas while struggling in others. You might advance to HMM2 quickly, plateau there for extended periods, then rapidly advance to HMM3 once certain blockers are removed. External events (budget cuts, reorganizations, major incidents) can cause temporary regression. This is normal - what matters is overall trajectory over time.

## The Relationship Between Maturity and Value

An important question: does higher maturity always mean more value? Not necessarily. The relationship between maturity and value is complex:

**Diminishing Returns**: Early maturity advancement (HMM0→1→2) often produces dramatic value improvements. Later advancement (HMM3→4) produces incremental improvements that may or may not justify the investment depending on context.

**Context-Dependent Value**: HMM4 capabilities provide enormous value to organizations facing sophisticated threats but minimal value to those facing primarily commodity threats. Appropriate maturity depends on your specific threat landscape.

**Opportunity Cost**: Resources invested in advancing hunting maturity could alternatively improve other security capabilities. Sometimes investing in better SOC operations, enhanced detection engineering, or improved incident response provides better overall security value than advancing hunting maturity.

**Sustainability**: HMM2 capability that's sustainable and well-integrated often provides more enduring value than HMM3 capability that requires constant struggle to maintain and risks regression.

The key is matching maturity to need. Don't pursue higher maturity simply because it exists - pursue the maturity level that provides optimal security value given your threat landscape, resources, and organizational context.
