## **What is Sysmon?**

### **Origins and Evolution**

System Monitor, universally known as Sysmon, was created by Mark Russinovich and Thomas Garnier as part of Microsoft's Sysinternals suite. First released in 2014, Sysmon was designed to address a fundamental gap in Windows native logging: the lack of detailed, security-relevant system activity telemetry.

Prior to Sysmon, security teams attempting to investigate compromises on Windows systems faced significant challenges. Windows Event Logs provided some information about security-relevant events (logons, privilege escalations, etc.), but critical details were missing. When a process was created, Event Logs might tell you _that_ it happened, but not what command-line arguments were used, what parent process spawned it, or what file hashes were involved. Network connections were even worse - Windows provided essentially no native logging of outbound TCP/UDP connections initiated by processes.

Sysmon changed this paradigm. By implementing a kernel-level device driver that hooks into critical system APIs, Sysmon captures granular information about process creation, network activity, file operations, registry modifications, and numerous other security-relevant events. This telemetry is written to a dedicated Windows Event Log channel (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`), making it easily accessible to SIEM platforms, log aggregators, and manual analysis tools.

Over the years, Sysmon has evolved substantially. The current version (v15.15 as of this writing) includes 29 distinct event types covering everything from process creation to clipboard capture to DNS queries. Each release has added new capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and minimal performance impact.
