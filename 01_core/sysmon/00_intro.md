## **What is Sysmon?**

### **Origins and Evolution**

System Monitor, universally known as Sysmon, was created by Mark Russinovich and Thomas Garnier as part of Microsoft's Sysinternals suite. First released in 2014, Sysmon was designed to address a fundamental gap in Windows native logging: the lack of detailed, security-relevant system activity telemetry.

Prior to Sysmon, security teams attempting to investigate compromises on Windows systems faced significant challenges. Windows Event Logs provided some information about security-relevant events (logons, privilege escalations, etc.), but critical details were missing. When a process was created, Event Logs might tell you _that_ it happened, but not what command-line arguments were used, what parent process spawned it, or what file hashes were involved. Network connections were even worse - Windows provided essentially no native logging of outbound TCP/UDP connections initiated by processes.

Sysmon changed this paradigm. By implementing a kernel-level device driver that hooks into critical system APIs, Sysmon captures granular information about process creation, network activity, file operations, registry modifications, and numerous other security-relevant events. This telemetry is written to a dedicated Windows Event Log channel (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`), making it easily accessible to SIEM platforms, log aggregators, and manual analysis tools.

Over the years, Sysmon has evolved substantially. The current version (v15.15 as of this writing) includes 29 distinct event types covering everything from process creation to clipboard capture to DNS queries. Each release has added new capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and minimal performance impact.


### **Architecture and Design Philosophy**

Sysmon operates through a kernel-mode device driver (`SysmonDrv.sys`) and a user-mode service (`Sysmon64.exe` or `Sysmon.exe`). This hybrid architecture allows it to intercept low-level system calls while maintaining stability and manageability.

The design philosophy behind Sysmon emphasizes several key principles:

**Minimal Performance Impact**: Sysmon is highly optimized to minimize CPU and I/O overhead. In most environments, Sysmon adds less than 1-2% CPU utilization even on busy servers. This is achieved through efficient filtering, intelligent buffering, and careful selection of which events to monitor.

**Persistence Across Reboots**: Once installed, Sysmon automatically starts with Windows and survives reboots, ensuring continuous monitoring without administrative intervention.

**Configurable Filtering**: Rather than logging everything (which would generate overwhelming volumes of data), Sysmon uses an XML-based configuration file that allows administrators to define precisely what events should be captured and what should be ignored.

**Integration with Windows Event Log**: By leveraging the native Windows Event Log infrastructure, Sysmon ensures compatibility with existing log forwarding tools (Windows Event Forwarding, Splunk Universal Forwarder, etc.) and SIEM platforms.

**Free and Officially Supported**: As part of the Sysinternals suite, Sysmon is provided free of charge by Microsoft with official support and regular updates.



### **Core Capabilities**

Sysmon's telemetry encompasses several categories of system activity:

**Process Tracking**: Detailed information about process creation (command lines, hashes, parent processes), process termination, and process access (when one process opens a handle to another).

**Network Activity**: All TCP and UDP connections initiated by processes, including source/destination IPs, ports, and process context.

**File System Operations**: File creation, file streams (Alternate Data Streams), and file deletion events.

**Registry Operations**: Registry key and value creation, modification, and deletion, along with registry object access.

**Image/Module Loading**: When executables and DLLs are loaded into process memory, capturing unsigned or suspicious modules.

**Driver Loading**: When kernel-mode drivers are loaded, a critical indicator for rootkits and kernel-level malware.

**Inter-Process Communication**: Named pipe creation and connection events, revealing C2 agent-to-agent communication channels.

**WMI Activity**: Windows Management Instrumentation event filters, consumers, and bindings-common persistence mechanisms.

**DNS Queries**: All DNS lookups performed by processes (Event ID 22, added in recent versions).

**Clipboard Capture**: Changes to clipboard contents (Event ID 24, added in v13.0).

This breadth of coverage makes Sysmon an exceptionally powerful tool for threat hunting, incident response, and forensic investigation.
