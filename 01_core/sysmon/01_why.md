## **Why Sysmon for Network Threat Hunting?**

At first glance, it might seem paradoxical to emphasize an _endpoint_ tool in the context of _network_ threat hunting. However, this apparent contradiction reveals a fundamental truth about modern threat detection: the network layer and endpoint layer are deeply interconnected, and comprehensive threat hunting requires visibility into both.

### **Bridging the Network-Endpoint Gap**

Traditional network monitoring tools like Zeek, Suricata, and RITA excel at analyzing packets crossing network boundaries. They identify beaconing patterns, suspicious domains, unusual protocols, and data exfiltration - all critical capabilities. However, they see traffic in aggregate without understanding the _host context_ behind each connection.

Consider a RITA alert showing a connection from 192.168.1.100 to a suspicious external IP. Network tools can tell you:

- The connection exists
- It exhibits beaconing behavior
- Significant data was transferred
- The connection duration is unusual

But they _cannot_ tell you:

- What process initiated the connection
- What user context the process was running under
- Whether the process is a legitimate application or known malware
- What other activities that process performed on the endpoint
- What parent process spawned it and why

Sysmon fills this gap. When correlated with network-based alerts, Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connection) provides the missing context that transforms a network anomaly into actionable intelligence. You now know that the connection was initiated by `powershell.exe` running as `SYSTEM`, spawned by `svchost.exe`, with command-line arguments that decode to a Base64-encoded stager script. Suddenly, you've moved from "suspicious connection" to "confirmed compromise with detailed attacker TTPs."

### **Detecting East-West Threats**

Sophisticated attackers increasingly leverage lateral movement and agent-to-agent communication to evade perimeter monitoring. When a compromised host communicates with other internal systems via SMB, RDP, WinRM, or custom protocols, these connections often bypass network security monitoring entirely because they occur within the same network segment.

Sysmon provides visibility into these lateral movements:

**Event ID 3** logs all network connections, including those to internal RFC 1918 addresses that perimeter tools never see.

**Event IDs 17 and 18** expose named pipe operations, revealing agent-to-agent C2 channels operating over SMB.

**Event ID 1** tracks process creation, allowing you to identify lateral movement tools like `psexec.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being used to execute commands on remote systems.

This east-west visibility is not supplementary - it's essential. The most damaging compromises typically involve attackers moving laterally from an initial beachhead to high-value targets within the network. If you can only see north-south traffic, you're detecting the initial compromise but missing the subsequent progression that leads to data exfiltration or ransomware deployment.
